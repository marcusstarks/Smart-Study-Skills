        <div class="what">
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>Retrieval Practice is the act of remembering something or “bringing it to mind” as learning scientists say. This could be simply trying to write down everything you know about a subject on a blank page, or taking a practice test or using flash cards (if done correctly). The key is to not use notes or readings and just try to remember on your own.

                Research has shown this to be one of the most effective study techniques.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why">
            <h3>Why is it effective</h3>
            <p>• Stronger Connections: the process of searching your memory for an item makes it easier to find that memory later. It’s like there is a path through the jungle to the thing you want to remember and each time go down the path it gets clearer and easier to follow.</p>
            <p>• More Refined: each time you access your memory it changes a bit and gets better organized and stored in your memory.</p>
            <p>• More Connections: our memories are connected to each other and the more we access them</p>
            <p>• Know what you know and don’t’ know: going through the process shows you want you remember and what you don’t so you know what you need to work on.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="how">
            <h3>How to use Retrieval Practice</h3>
            <p>• Take a practice test.</p>
            <p>• Make Flash cards. Take time and think hard before flipping the card over.</p>
            <p>• Draw a diagram of what you know from memory.</p>
            <p>• Check Yourself: a very important part of Retrieval Practice is to check yourself for accuracy. After a practice test check your answers. After you write down all you know on a sheet of paper check notes and readings to see what you missed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="when">
            <h3>When to use Retrieval Practice</h3>
            <p>• When you have time before a test/quiz etc. (it’s not something that works as well the night before).</p>
            <p>• Other than that retrieval practice can be used in most classroom situations. That’s part of why it’s an effective technique.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tips">
            <h3>Tips and Ticks</h3>
            <p>• If you don’t have access to a practice test ask your professor for one or make your own if there is no one available. You can collaborate with friends to make tests using tools like Quizlet, Kahoot or even Google or Microsoft Forms.</p>
            <p>• Don’t just cram the night before. By practicing retrieval multiple times over a period of time you create the strongest, most connected, longest lasting memories.</p>
            <p>• Retrieval practice is NOT rereading notes, listening to lectures or similar activities.</p>
            <p>• It can feel hard, especially at first. That’s OK! This difficulty is part of learning and forming memories.</p>
