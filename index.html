		<p class="attractor">Study smarter by using methods that have been scientifically shown to help you remember more, for longer and better connect learning across subjects.</p>
		<p class="intro">This web site is designed to help you understand and begin to use high-quality study skills that will make the studying more effective and help you succeed at school.</p>

			<h2>Smart Study Skills</h2>
			<div class="skill">
				<h3>Retrieval Practice</h3>
				<p>The act of trying to remember ideas, through techniques like flash cards to practice tests, actually helps make it easier to remember those ideas and connect them to each other</p>
			</div>
			<div class="skill">
				<h3>Spaced Practice</h3>
				<p>This simple method of spacing out your studying makes a big difference in helping to form lasting memories.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="skill">
				<h3>Elaboration</h3>
				<p>Use your own words and add details to the concepts you’re learning to make them your own and make it easier to recall them later.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="skill">
				<h3>Interleaving</h3>
				<p>Instead of studying the same things in the same order over and over, try mixing things up with Interleaving.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="skill">
				<h3>Concrete Examples</h3>
				<p>It’s easier to remember ideas that we can visualize and connect to ideas we already know. Learning and creating specific examples of abstract concepts does just that.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="skill">
				<h3>Dual Coding</h3>
				<p>Combine visuals like pictures, diagrams or your own drawings, with text gives your brain more to latch on to and more pathways to remember.</p>
